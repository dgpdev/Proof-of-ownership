I'm going to keep this short.

### - The team claims the contract lacks the logic to burn the token.

Here is the owner wallet holding 600k tokens:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x83d0aa2292efd8475df241fba42fe137da008d79

Here is the TX that this address created the contract:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa37db1899e66d7de7ae649d46bf28906984b7f409ff486f8dc3b66053fa97a96


Here is the proof that the owner (digipulse) **did manage to burn 150 tokens** to the burning address

As you can see, the contract is capable of burning tokens, but what is wrong at this point?

**OOOOPS....** That stupid @D3 created the contract with the **WRONG** wallet!

That's right! The contract works **as it should work** but your intelligent digipulse **CTO** created it with his personal wallet that later was used to buy **600k DGPT tokens from the original backers round**

So; Those tokens **CAN** be burned, they just don't want to burn them as it was meant to dump, and now confirmed by their claim the contract is broken.

There is **NO WAY** Zeppelin or anyone else will confirm these tokens burned, as you can see above: **THE TEAM CAN MOVE THOSE 600k TOKENS AROUND AS THEY PLEASE!!!!!**

TL;DR
----
 - The contract is **not** broken
 - The tokens **can** be moved freely
 - They sucessfully tested 150 tokens transfer to 0x0 (why only 150?)
 - The **CTO** was so dumb to use his personal wallet as owner
 - They still owe me a shitload of money
 - I'm tired of their false accusations
 
 Peace out, Skippy
