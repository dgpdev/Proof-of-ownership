# Proof-of-ownership
Counteract on digipulse claims


I've been contacted by D3 (Dmitry) on August 11 2017, when digipulse is just another failed product using 2 tokens and a strange way of mining tokens. (reference of the old concept: https://www.coinstaker.com/initial-coin-offering/digipulse-ico/)

After some skype calls I agreed to make a proof of concept, where the users could actually store **anything**, like some dropbox.
The proof of concept has been uploaded to the Github of a project that got my help back then.

Nicknamed 'testament', the first version of what is known as digipulse is pushed on August 16 2017

The readme attachement clearly says:

```
Proof of concept by Tarmi

After some meetings, both physical as online, we agreed that i would help them in my spare time to develop the product.
In return, i would receive 1% of the token supply worth 0$ at that very moment.

Everything went fine and the concept took shape. The digipulse as we know it today was formed, and a successfull alpha version was developed by me.

As time progressed, i couldn't find myself anyome in the team, it's dynamic, and especially the attitude of some people in the team.
My red flags got raised when the CTO started talking to me about creating an ICO to make a lot of money in a short time.

One thing led to another, and so came the end for me at digipulse.

I notified the team to stop using the services i developed and created by means of a public gist:

Eversince, the digipulse dudes got silent. Now and then i had a brief communication with Norms (a really cool guy!) who admitted that they might not have been receiving the letters sent by me and my lawyers

I've been granted the intellectual and authors rights regarding the code in mean time.
The only step left is to sue them, since they refuse to handle it like gentleman and forcing me to go public with this.

You can read my claims in the PDF file in this very repo. It's dutch, but feel free to google translate it ;-)
